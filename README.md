Abstract:

In recent years, the application of computer vision and deep learning techniques has revolutionized various industries, including food quality assessment. This project presents a comprehensive approach to building a meat quality assessment system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to videos. The primary goal was to create an automated system capable of predicting the quality of meat in real-time based on visual cues extracted from videos.

The project journey began by collecting a diverse dataset of meat samples, captured as videos, with variations in quality attributes. Extensive image preprocessing techniques, including resizing, rescaling, and data augmentation, were employed to enhance the dataset's diversity and quality. Subsequently, a CNN model was designed and trained using the preprocessed video frames to effectively capture intricate patterns associated with meat quality attributes.

The developed CNN model demonstrated its capability to learn complex relationships between visual features and meat quality. Leveraging Python and OpenCV, the trained model was integrated into a video processing pipeline. The pipeline processes each frame of a given video, performs preprocessing, and feeds the frames through the CNN model for prediction. The prediction outcomes are then used to assess the meat quality, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis.

The successful implementation of this meat quality assessment system showcases its potential for enhancing food safety and quality control in the meat industry. The project demonstrates the fusion of computer vision, deep learning, and real-time video analysis to provide a practical and efficient solution for automated meat quality assessment.
